# Metaphor Detection using Machine Learning Project Summary

This project focuses on developing a model for metaphor detection using machine learning techniques. The key steps implemented in this project are as follows:

## 1. Data Preparation

- **Conversion of Metaphor IDs to Metaphor Words:** Replacing metaphor IDs with corresponding metaphor words to establish a direct link between textual instances and specific metaphors.
- **Feature Engineering:** Truncating text to a single sentence containing the metaphor word to enhance the model's focus on the immediate context of the metaphor.

## 2. Model Architecture

- **BERT-Based Sequence Classifier:** Utilizing a pre-trained BERT model for sequence classification, leveraging BERT's contextual embeddings to discern subtle nuances in language usage.
- **Key Features of BERT:** Bidirectional context processing, state-of-the-art natural language processing model with multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms.

## 3. Significance of the Dataset

- The dataset used in this project is meticulously crafted and labeled, facilitating robust metaphor detection model training and exploration of metaphor usage intricacies in natural language.
- Clear differentiation between literal and metaphorical instances enables the model to discern nuanced language patterns and make informed predictions.

## 4. Methodologies

- Two distinct methodologies are explored, leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques and deep learning models for effective metaphor detection.

## 5. Evaluation Metrics

- Precision is highlighted as a crucial metric in assessing the model's reliability in correctly classifying metaphorical instances.

This project contributes to advancing the field of natural language processing by addressing the challenges posed by metaphorical language and providing a valuable tool for understanding and analyzing textual content. The results and implications of the findings are discussed in detail, showcasing advancements in metaphor identification using machine learning.
